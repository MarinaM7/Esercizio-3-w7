                <h3>Sugarloaf Rock</h3>
                <p>Sugarloaf Rock is a gigantic granite rock that emerges from the <b><i>Indian Ocean</i></b> extremely close to the mainland. The rock is situated within a designated nature reserve in the <b><i>Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park</i></b> just off Cape Naturaliste near Dunsborough. As you approach Sugarloaf Rock you will instantly see why this towering, sea-sculptured rock is one of the most photographed coastal landforms in the region. With its ocean side often battered by treacherous seas, and the rock separated from the coast by a narrow channel of wild water, this is an <b><i>incredible seascape</i></b> - best viewed from the elevated lookout.

                    Sugarloaf Rock is a <b><i>bird watcher's and nature lover’s paradise</i></b>. As a nature reserve, it is a haven for <u>nesting seabirds</u> and is home to the geographically restricted and graceful red-tailed <u>tropic bird</u> which nests here from September to February each year. But that’s not the only wildlife you may see. <u>Playful bottlenose dolphins</u> can often be seen leaping through the surf break close by, sometimes together with the surfers. <u>Humpback and southern right whales</u> are often seen wallowing, breaching or just cruising by on their migration (best time July - October). </span>
